<p>I'm going to be using my same story theme from week one project. preparing to fight a dragon, I want to go into more detail by using the flow charts that are provided in this weeks assignment.</p>
<p>I decided to go with my same story from week one with hopes that I can put a bigger picture together and add a few new things with the flowcharts given for this weeks assignment and along with everything that I learned this week in SDI.</p>
